# chewBBACA

**chewBBACA** stands for "BSR-Based Allele Calling Algorithm". The "chew" part could be thought of as "Comprehensive and  Highly Efficient Workflow" 
but at this point still it needs a bit of work to make that claim so we just add "chew" to add extra coolness to the software name. BSR stands for 
BLAST Score Ratio as proposed by [Rasko DA et al.](http://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-6-2) 

chewBBACA is a comprehensive pipeline including a set of functions for the creation and validation of whole genome and core genome MultiLocus Sequence 
Typing (wg/cgMLST) schemas, providing an allele calling algorithm based on Blast Score Ratio that can be run in multiprocessor 
settings and a set of functions to visualize and validate allele variation in the loci. chewBBACA performs the schema creation and allele calls on complete or draft genomes.

### Check the [documentation](https://chewbbaca.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for implementation details and guidance on using chewBBACA.

## News

## 3.0.0 - 2022-12-14

- New implementation of the **AlleleCall** process. The new implementation was developed to reduce execution time, improve accuracy and provide more detailed results.
